Real-time prediction market tremor monitoring dashboard that tracks and visualizes market movements with intensity scoring.

<!-- ![TREMOR.LIVE Dashboard](https://github.com/sculptdotfun/tremor/assets/tremor-preview.png) -->

## Overview

TREMOR.LIVE monitors prediction markets from Polymarket in real-time, calculating "tremor intensity" scores based on price movements, volume, and market volatility. The dashboard provides instant insights into significant market shifts and emerging trends.

## Features

- **Real-time Market Monitoring** - Tracks prediction markets every 15-60 seconds
- **Tremor Intensity Scoring** - 0-10 scale quantifying market movement significance
- **Multi-timeframe Analysis** - 5-minute, 1-hour, 24-hour, 7-day, 30-day, Quarter-to-Date (1Q), 1-year, plus specific named quarters (e.g., 2025 Q1)
- **Smart Data Prioritization** - Hot/warm/cold market classification for efficient syncing
- **Intensity Filtering** - Filter movements by intensity levels (Extreme, High, Moderate, Low)
- **Visual Indicators** - Color-coded intensity bars and category badges
- **Automated Data Retention** - Daily cleanup to maintain optimal performance

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router & Turbopack
- **Database:** Convex (real-time, reactive database)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **API:** Polymarket Gamma API
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Package Manager:** pnpm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Convex account
- Polymarket API access

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_deployment_url
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_deployment_name
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key
```

### Development

```bash
# Start Convex dev server
pnpm convex dev

# In another terminal, start Next.js
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Convex
pnpm convex deploy

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Polymarket API â†’ Convex Actions â†’ Database â†’ Scoring Engine â†’ React Frontend
```

### Database Schema

- **events** - Prediction market events with metadata
- **markets** - Individual markets within events
- **priceSnapshots** - Time-series price data (7-day retention)
- **scores** - Computed intensity scores (24-hour retention)
- **baselines** - Statistical baselines for normalization
- **marketSyncState** - Sync priority tracking

### Sync Schedule

- **Hot Markets:** Every 15 seconds (high activity)
- **Warm Markets:** Every 60 seconds (moderate activity)
- **Events:** Every 2 minutes (metadata updates)
- **Scoring:** Every minute (intensity calculations)
- **Baselines:** Daily at 2 AM UTC
- **Cleanup:** Daily at 3 AM UTC

## Intensity Scoring

The Seismo score (0-10) is calculated based on:
- Price movement magnitude
- Trading volume
- Market volatility
- Statistical deviation from baseline

### Intensity Levels

- **ðŸ”´ EXTREME** (7.5+): Major market disruption
- **ðŸŸ  HIGH** (5.0-7.5): Significant movement
- **ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE** (2.5-5.0): Notable activity
- **âšª LOW** (0-2.5): Minor fluctuations

## Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm start        # Start production server
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm format       # Format code with Prettier
pnpm typecheck    # Run TypeScript checking
pnpm convex dev   # Start Convex dev server
pnpm convex deploy # Deploy to Convex production
```

## Public API (v1)

- `GET /api/v1/events/top?window=1440m&limit=20` â€” Top events with tremor stats for a window (`5m,60m,1440m,7d,30d,1Q,1y,q:YYYY-QN`)
- `GET /api/v1/events/:eventId?window=1440m&include=markets,scores` â€” Full event metadata with markets and latest scores
- `GET /api/v1/search?query=...&window=1440m` â€” Search events and include a lightweight score for the window
- `GET /api/v1/windows` â€” Supported windows plus current/last quarter IDs
